3.	Which province experienced the highest increase in Composite House Price Index (HPI) during the given timeframe?
Code 
with alberta_percent_increase_since_2005 as (with cte as (select extract (year from date) as year,

year	percent_increase_from_2005
2023	55.5



Ontario

Overall 
year	alberta_percent_increase_from_2005	ontario_percent_increase_from_2005
2023	55.5	69.42

Hence, we can conclude that Ontario has on an average 14 % more increase in house prices. 







To put things into perspective,
Consider a house priced at 400k in 2005.
, today that same house will be worth 620k in Alberta and 676k in Ontario.


Price in 2005	                            Current Price in Ontario        	              Current price in Alberta
400k	                                                  676k	                                                            620k
